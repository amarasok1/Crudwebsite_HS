About the project/software: The purpose of my website was to create an easily accessible career search program. I had designed this job search website in order to help the user find a job based on salary and location. In order to create the website I started with the HTML template. I also made a database and called it job_search.l I was at first confused on how to connect the database to HTML being that most of the assignments were PHP, however I did a lot of googling and supposedly you're not even supposed to combine HTML and PHP in one file. However, I was overall able to utilize the languages PHP, CSS, Javascript ect in order to create an operative job search website for the user
